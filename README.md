<h1><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iampavangandhi/iampavangandhi/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="30px"> HTML, CSS & JavaScript Learning Project</h1>
This repository contains the code for my HTML and CSS learning project. It's a simple webpage that I created while learning the basics of web development using these technologies.

The project consists of several HTML files that define the structure of the webpage and CSS files that control its visual appearance. I've also included some images and other assets that are used in the webpage.

Feel free to take a look at the code and use it as a reference for your own learning projects. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me.
